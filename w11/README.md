# Function Declaration (Hoisting):

- I understand function declaration and the returning value within that function. What orginally confused me was the difference between the argument and parameter and how they are used in the code. I previously got confused with these terms. I also sometimes struggled to understand how do I use that return value in the function as decleared variable to be referenced in other functions. But the video and this code along video helped my understanding of this concept.
- A default value can be set in the parameter if nothing is passed through it.
- IIFE (immediately invoked function expression) is called immediately after it is defined. It is used a closure for decleared variables and returned values that cannot be accessed outside of the closure.
